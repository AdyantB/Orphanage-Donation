                <p>There are over 143 million orphans around the world. If these children stood side by side they would form a
line of children 30,000 miles long.Besides children who are orphaned (having lost one or both parents),
there are countless children who live in a family unit who are vulnerable due to extreme 
poverty, hunger, thirst, abuse and neglect.</p><br>

<p>Together, orphans and vulnerable children represent a vast group of marginalized children. It would appear
 to many people that these children are worthless and unwanted. After all, since there are so many 
 and their numbers are growing, it is clear that they have little value to anyone else. The truth is this 
 however, these children are precious in the sight of God. In fact, they are of infinite 
 valueUnfortunately the number of children living in orphanages appears to be rising. This increase 
 contradicts global guidance and the stated policies of many governments directing the scaling down 
 of orphanage care.</p><br>

<p>Please help orphanage childrens by donating any amount you can.<a href="https://sjsa.maharashtra.gov.in/mr/ashram-shala-mr" target=_blank>Learn More</a></p>
